# Hello world!
## What is Memento-Mori-Bot?
Memento mori bot is modular, extandable, homebrew discord bot, running on discord.py>(2.0) that everyon can host(but you plese write in your bot description that it is running on my softwe).
I'm still developing it. Many fetures don't work after migration, but i'm doing my best to fix them.

How to use it?
download from source, make a new file called `key.py` that is following structure written in `app.py`

***Good luck and have fun!***
